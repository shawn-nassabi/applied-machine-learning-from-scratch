# Applied Machine Learning projects built from scratch

All the projects involve building machine learning (ML) models from scratch. Black-box models were not used. 

## ML models built include:
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of anime themed characters
- GoogLeNet convolutional neural network / deep learning model for image classification
- Fully connected neural network for classifying handwritten digits from MNIST dataset. This includes developing the backward and forward propagation algorithms.
- K-means clustering and K-means++ clustering
- Decision tree for classifying flower petals and also for detecting spam emails (trained on the spambase dataset).
- Support Vector Machine
- Linear regression
